# CS161, Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, Spring 2019

## Course Description
This course studies the design of intelligent agents. It introduces the fundamental problem-solving and knowledge-representation paradigms of artificial intelligence. We will study the AI programming language LISP, state-space and problem reduction methods, brute-force and heuristic search, planning techniques, two-player games, and recent developments in game AI. In knowledge representation and reasoning, we will cover propositional and first-order logic and their inference algorithms. Finally, the course covers probabilistic approaches to AI, such as Bayesian networks, and machine learning algorithms to improve the agent's performance with experience.

### Languages Covered 
Programming Language: Lisp

### Assignment Overviews
* H1 - Lisp Warm-Up
  * Wrote several functions (e.g. compute Nth Padovan number) to warm-up using Lisp for future programming assignments
* H2 - Fox, Goose, and Bag of Beans Puzzle 
  * Implemented a depth-first solver to solve a variation of the famous Fox, Goose, and Bag of Beans Puzzle (Homer, Baby, Dog, and Poison Problem from the Simpsons)
* H3 - Sokoban
  * Implemented the main components of a program to play the well-known puzzle video game Sokoban first introduced in Japan in 1980
